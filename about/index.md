His interest in web development started back when he opened a website for the first time as a child and asked himself why it was so slow.

He has worked in a wide spectrum of web projects, from fast content sites to projects with a focus on animation and user experience, always with a keen eye on performance and best practices.

## Experience

In his early days he delivered mobile first and accessible sites for clients like **Microsoft** and **StateFarm** and worked in JavaScript core applications for **OrderGroove** applying Agile methodologies and test driven development.

He later became a technical lead and developed cool animated web projects for clients including **ESPN**, **Facebook**, **Pixar**, **Marvel** and **Oreo**, and recently led the Design System team at **Typeform**.
