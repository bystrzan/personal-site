He has worked in a wide spectrum of web projects, from fast content sites to projects with a focus on animation and user experience, always with a keen eye on performance and best practices.

## Experience

Early in his career he worked on mobile first and accessible sites for clients like **Microsoft** and **StateFarm**, focusing in accessibility, cross browsing compatibility and design consistency.

In **OrderGroove** he helped build and maintain their core JavaScript applications with a keen eye on performance and code quality, all applying Agile methodologies.
